  <h3>To encourage reading among our students we :</h3>
  <p><br><br><b>Hold Book Talks:</b>
    As you start to learn more about the library, pass on what you've discovered to your students. If you're excited then that will spread to your students. Try sparking their curiosity and then invite your librarian to come and share with your
    students. Stumpenhorst used these classroom sessions as opportunities to teach students about the school library. He also held 'book talk' sessions. According to Stumpenhorst, one of the most powerful ways to encourage kids to read is to share
    what you are reading and why you love to read.
    <br><br><b>Visit the Library Often:</b>
    Take your students on a tour of the library so that they feel comfortable in the environment and are more at ease visiting on their own. Encourage your students to visit the library often outside of the classroom. If possible, incorporate a
    library day into your lesson plan and make time to go to the library as a class. There are numerous ways you can motivate students to use the library's resources through this time. For instance, assign group projects where students will need to
    find necessary books, media and other resources to complete the assignment. Another option is to hold a scavenger hunt in the library, which can encourage students to explore all sections of the library.
    <br><br><b>Create an In-Class Library:</b>
    If your students find the library a little overwhelming in the beginning, try creating an in-class library with a variety of books specifically tailored to your students and what they are learning in your classroom. Spend time each day
    encouraging students to browse this smaller library setting. Teacher Donalyn Miller has done just that for her students. In her blog article 'Introducing Students to the Classroom Library', Miller describes how she and her students use the
    classroom library to become more familiar with books, reading interests, and even library procedures such as checking out books, taking care of the books, and organizing them. It's a low key environment that gives Miller the opportunity to work
    one on one with her students in a library setting without all of the distractions of a larger school library.

    <br><br><b>Establish In-Class Reading Time:</b>
    Setting aside time to for in-class reading is a great way to encourage students to get excited about reading. This time can especially be used as an opportunity for your students to read their recent picks from the school library. Whether it's
    school related or just for fun, build reading time into class time. You can even use this time to read aloud to your students as well. No matter how you choose to incorporate reading into your students' lives, make sure to keep the school library
    as the number one resource.
