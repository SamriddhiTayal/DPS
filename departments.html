  <h3>ART</h3>
  <p>
    Welcome to Art and Design!
  </p>
  <p>
    In the Art department we are passionate about the study of art and we believe strongly in its value for each individual student.

    Art develops essential critical thinking skills and whereas much of what students’ learn in school is concrete, art classes encourage creative and abstract thought.
    Skills learnt in art are transferrable and art boosts academic performance, motivation and creativity in other subjects. </p>
  <h3>ENGLISH</h3>
  <p>
    Welcome to English!
  </p>
  <p>
    The English department at Cheam High school is passionate about Language and Literature. We want our students to be as passionate as we are.

    We believe that reading is fundamental for students to be able to excel in English as it opens their minds and imagination
    as well as helping to develop their vocabulary and grasp of grammar.</p>
  <h3>MATHEMATICS</h3>
  <p>
    Welcome to Maths!
  </p>
  <p>
    Mathematics contributes to the school curriculum by developing students’ abilities to solve problems,
    to calculate, to reason logically, algebraically, and geometrically and to make sense of data. Mathematics is important for students in many other areas of study, particularly Science and Technology. It is also
    important in everyday life, in many forms of employment and in decision-making.</p>

  <h3>SCIENCE</h3>
  <p>
    Welcome to Science!
  </p>
  <p>
    We are a department of enthusiastic scientists who
    believe that understanding scientific thinking is
    fundamental to making decisions in society that affect ourselves
    and others; it enables us to broaden our mind to make informed decisions about all aspects of our lives. We are passionate about Science as a way of understanding the universe, and the excitement and enjoyment
    it can bring to how we view the world around us. We encourage the study of Biology, Chemistry and Physics equally and separately, and promote the common skills required by all three.</p>
  <h3>SOCIAL SCIENCE</h3>
  <p>
    Welcome to Social Science!
  </p>
  <p>
    The department offers three subjects at Post 16 – Psychology, Sociology and Criminology.
    The department has been judged by the school to be consistently good overall with many elements being outstanding. The Social Science team firmly believes that all students are capable of great things and they set
    about instilling a growth mindset right from the beginning of their courses.</p>
